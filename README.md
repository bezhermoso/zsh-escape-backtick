zsh-escape-backtick
===================

## Important: If you happen to stumble on this don`t use it yet unless you want to lose ability to put in double-backticks

Quickly insert escaped backticks (<code>\\\`</code>) when double-tapping <code>\`</code>.

I sometimes need to add literal back-ticks in commit messages; this makes it a easier.
